Title- Dynamic Student Grouping System
The Dynamic Student Grouping System is an intelligent algorithm-based solution designed to automatically form balanced student groups for academic projects, activities, or competitions. Traditional group formation methods often lead to uneven team compositions, where some groups may have too many high performers while others lack necessary skills. This system ensures fairness and efficiency by considering multiple factors such as academic performance, interests, residence and past collaborations while forming groups dynamically.
